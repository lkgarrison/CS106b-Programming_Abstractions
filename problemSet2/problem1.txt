a) vector<eMailMsg> emailContainer;

b) 
	void removeSpam(vector<eMailMsg> & emails) {
		for(int i = 0; i < emails.size(); i++) {
			if(emails[i].subject.find("SPAM") == 0) {
				emails.erase(emails.begin() + i);
				i--; // reset incrementer to account for removal
			}
		}
	}

c) 	One could change the type of the "to" field to be a vector of strings instead of a string. This way, multiple email addresses could be added to the "to" field. Thus, the struct definition would be:
	struct eMailMsg {
		vector<string> to;
		string from;
		...
		...
	};

	To access the last address listed in the "to" field, use:
		email.to[email.to.size() - 1]
